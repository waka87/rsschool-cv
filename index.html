    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>My purpose is to become a developer. I'm working right now in IT industry. I want to change my direction to development because it's more interesting for me. Earlier I didn't realize that my job will take a lot time of my life. But becoming older I want to spend my time for work that really means a lot for me, that I really like and enjoy. My priorities are my family, my work and being happy. My strengths are responsibility and honesty. I do like studying and self-development.</p>
